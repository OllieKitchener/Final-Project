I created a password strength checker but with an interesting twist. It will have the typical length and character requirements, but I am also adding prompts that require you to include weird ideas, like CAPTCHAs and a colour of the rainbow. Before the user can enter their password, they are forced to type in the name field. As the user is typing, it will update the estimated time to guess based on what they type. When the user starts to type in their password, a timer begins and will not stop until the user has finished all the prompts. Once the user has finished their password, whatever they typed in the name field, and whatever time they got, and appends it to a leaderboard file which the user can get with the download button. I intend this to be both an interesting game and also a way to make people think harder about how to make their password stronger. This idea was heavily inspired by Neal.fun’s “The Password Game” as I thought it was the prime example of applying an idea from Cyber Security and Game Development together without it being abstract.
